# Flight Price Prediction

This project predicts flight prices based on various features using machine learning. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training. The trained model is deployed using AWS SageMaker and integrated into a Streamlit web application for user interaction.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the dataset to understand patterns, trends, and correlations between features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and selected the best 13 out of the original 31 columns based on their importance and correlation with the target variable.
4. **Model Training**: Trained a machine learning model on AWS SageMaker using EC2 and S3.
5. **Model Deployment**: Deployed the trained model using the AWS SageMaker Boto3 SDK.
6. **Web Application**: Developed a Streamlit web application to provide an interface for users to input flight details and get price predictions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas joblib streamlit matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost feature-engine boto3
```

## Data Cleaning

The dataset was cleaned by:

- Handling missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
- Identifying and removing outliers using statistical methods.
- Standardizing and normalizing the data to ensure consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed EDA to understand the dataset better. Key steps included:

- Visualizing the distribution of flight prices.
- Analyzing correlations between features and the target variable (price).
- Identifying patterns and trends in the data.

## Feature Engineering

Created new features and selected the best 13 columns out of 31. The process involved:

- Creating datetime features (e.g., day of week, month).
- Encoding categorical variables using techniques like OneHotEncoder and MeanEncoder.
- Scaling and normalizing numerical features.
- Using FeatureUnion and ColumnTransformer to streamline feature processing.

## Model Training

Trained the model using AWS SageMaker:

1. **Setup**: Configured AWS EC2 for computation and S3 for data storage.
2. **Training**: Used the `xgboost` algorithm and trained the model with the selected features.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like R2 score and mean absolute error.

## Model Deployment

Deployed the model using the AWS SageMaker Boto3 SDK:

1. **Model Registration**: Registered the trained model in SageMaker.
2. **Endpoint Configuration**: Created an endpoint for real-time inference.
3. **Deployment**: Deployed the model to the endpoint for online predictions.

## Web Application

Developed a Streamlit web application for user interaction:

- Users can input flight details (e.g., airline, date of journey, source, destination, etc.).
- The app processes the input, makes predictions using the deployed model, and displays the predicted flight price.

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-price-prediction.git
    cd flight-price-prediction
    ```

2. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.
